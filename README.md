# Tales of Twitter
What if we could see the sentiments of people through the breadcrumbs they leave on TwitterÂ ?

## Quick Access Links

This project is described in details in [this article](https://medium.com/@redouane.achouri/twitter-sentiment-analysis-a-tale-of-stream-processing-8fd92e19a6e6).

Final dashboard can be found here: [grafana.redouaneachouri.com](https://grafana.redouaneachouri.com/d/twitter-sentiment-analysis/twitter-sentiment-analysis).

The Modelization part is described at [./model/twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb](./model/twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb).

## Updates
- __Saturday, 23rd May 2020__: Changed the InfluxDB retention policy to 30 days to limit disk space consumption. Previous retention was defaulting to infinite. Older data has been discarded and new data starts to be recorded as of this day. See below for [How to Setup a Retention Policy](#how-to-setup-a-retention-policy).

- __Sunday, 24th May 2020__: Found a way to change the retention policy while keeping the old (accumulated, undeleted) records. See [Keep old records](#keep-old-records) below for instructions.

- __Monday, 12th October 2020__: Twitter discontinues some Labs v1 API endpoints (including the sample stream endpoint used by this project), after having launched a new version of its API. I've taken changes into consideration and the project is up-to-date.

- __Saturday, 17th October 2020__: Added a worldmap panel to visualize where tweets were emitted.


## Deployment

Local deployment is done through this [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file.

Live deployment instructions will be published in a separate tutorial/instructions which will consist mainly of how to setup SSL Encryption with a reverse NGINX proxy to enable Let's Encrypt. Following tutorials will be helpful if you want to setup your own encryption machinery: [Nginx Proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) and [Let's Encrypt](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion).

Compose offers a way to control the order of statup and shutdown of containers through the `depends_on` option, but, by design, [there is no way to delay statup until a service becomes available](https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/) - unless we run a script that waits for a service to become available with a `command` option.

> The problem of waiting for a database (for example) to be ready is really just a subset of a much larger problem of distributed systems. In production, your database could become unavailable or move hosts at any time. Your application needs to be resilient to these types of failures.

> To handle this, design your application to attempt to re-establish a connection to the database after a failure. If the application retries the connection, it can eventually connect to the database.

### Requirements

- After obtaining your set of Twitter API key and secret (See article mentioned above), you have to set those in the [secret.ini](./produce-tweets/secret.ini) file.

- Run the Jupter Notebook [twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb](./model/twitter-sentiment-analysis.ipynb) to build a model and save it in a *.pickle* file. See the (README.md)[./model/README.md] file for running instructions.

### Starting the Services

Services need to be started in a specific order with the following commands:
```
# Start Kafka and InfluxDB
docker-compose up -d kafka influxdb

# Start Grafana
docker-compose up -d grafana

# Start the producer and the consumer
docker-compose up -d producer consumer
```

#### How to Setup a Retention Policy

Following instructions show how to setup a retention policy of 30 days for InfluxDB. The DB names are defined in the [config.ini](./config.ini) file.

```
# On your server, log into the InfluxDB container:
docker exec -it twittersentimentanalysis_influxdb bash

# Start the influx prompt (useful execute InfluxQL queries)
influx # you can add '-precision rfc3339' to print timestamps to a human-readable format
```

##### Keep old records
```
# List existing retention policies
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON sentiments
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON languages

# Alter default policy (generally named 'autogen')
ALTER RETENTION POLICY autogen ON sentiments DURATION 30d
ALTER RETENTION POLICY autogen ON languages DURATION 30d
```

##### Start recording from scratch

```
# Create new retention policy and set the duration to 30 days
CREATE RETENTION POLICY one_month ON sentiments DURATION 30d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
CREATE RETENTION POLICY one_month ON languages DURATION 30d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
```

Once all finished:
```
# Verify that it has been set successfully
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON sentiments
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON languages

# Exit the terminal with Ctrl+D
```
